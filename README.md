# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Desciption 
  This work day scheduler was a lot of fun to make! I definitely learned a lot while doing this one. On the side I started developing a calendar web app and I'm going to have it so when you click on a date a work day scheduler similar to this one pops up, i'm excited to develop that further. The work day Scheduler here displays the day that it is at the top using a third party api called moment.JS, That date refreshes at midnight to the next day automatically, that's pretty awesome. I didn't go all out with the design elements as I usually do, saving that for the big calendar app I'm making that I mentioned earlier but the functionality meets all the requirements. The trickiest part of this project was getting the local storage to save after refreshing. The same issue I was having with my code quiz, but I was able to get it here! And not only that, but how I originally wrote the code was 10 lines of code, each hour was written out individually like "  $('#8 .description').val(localStorage.getItem('8'))" which took up a bunch of lines, but it worked. After looking it over and some advice from a tutor I was actually just able to write a for loop that did the same thing but only had it take up 2 lines of code, and figuring that out for me, was a big win!

## Installation
 
N/A
 
## Usage
The usage of the work day scheduler is very easy. Log what you want to accomplish or have going on in a certain hour block and hit the save button. Boom all done. There are some other attributes to the page that make the entire thing a little more cohesive for example: Once the hour enters a new hour (8am turns to 9am) the 8am section of the scheduler will turn gray, while the active hour is in red, and the hours to come are in green. This format was predetermined for us to use but I do like the idea behind a visual representation of time passing that is not a clock.

Unfortunately I didnt get a screenshot of the program earlier than 5 so you could see the color changes throughout the day.
